# A template for Python projects

The purpose of this project is just to suggest a layout for Python projects including:

- source code
- tests

## Tests

I use `pytest` for testing, the test cases are collected into the `tests` folder. To run the tests:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=.:${PYTHONPATH} pytests ./tests
```
